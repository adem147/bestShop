## 🗃️ Database Overview

### 👤 `USER`

- `USER_ID`: User ID

- `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME`, `PHONE` : Other details...
- Wishlist and Cart are tied to the user

---

### 🛒 `PRODUCT`

- `PRD_ID`: Product ID
- `PRD_NAME`: Name of the product
- `DESCRIPTION`, `BRAND`, `CREATED_AT`: Other details...

---

### 🏬 `SHOP`

- `SHP_ID`: Shop ID

## 🔍 Smart Search Example

When a user searches for a product, BestShop not only returns matching product names but also fetches:

- All relevant characteristics (e.g., screen size, RAM)
- Available values for each characteristic
- Count of items matching each value

This enables dynamic filtering (e.g., “show all 8GB RAM laptops”) and a better shopping experience.
